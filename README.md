- Auto accept loadout recommendations and sort by preference.
- Skipping the Launcher and Intro movie.
- Better gun info tooltips and ship stat panels.

A complete description of all features will be added soon. In the meantime, you can learn some of the features from reading the [release notes](https://github.com/DrPitLazarus/buffkit/releases). Work-in-Progress [BuffKit Wiki](https://github.com/DrPitLazarus/buffkit/wiki).

## Install Options
1. [BuffKit Mod Installer for Windows](BuffKitModInstaller/#readme)
2. Manual install from .zip file.
    1. Visit latest [release page](https://github.com/DrPitLazarus/buffkit/releases/latest) and download .zip file. Or [view all releases](https://github.com/DrPitLazarus/buffkit/releases).
    2. Open downloaded .zip file.
    3. Open your `Guns of Icarus Online` folder.
    4. Drag and drop .zip contents to your game folder, overwrite if prompted.
    5. **Additional steps for Linux**: Use Proton and add to your launch options:  
    `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b" %command%`.

## Uninstall Options
1. Use either uninstall option in [BuffKit Mod Installer for Windows](BuffKitModInstaller/#readme).
2. Manual uninstall but keep mod settings:
   - Delete file `Guns of Icarus Online\BepInEx\plugins\BuffKit\BuffKit.dll`.
   - If you want to disable the mod, rename the file extension to not a .dll. For example: `BuffKit.dll.bk`
3. Manual clean uninstall:
   - Delete folder `Guns of Icarus Online\BepInEx\plugins\BuffKit`.
   - If you want to backup the folder, the backup cannot live in the `Guns of Icarus Online\BepInEx\plugins` folder. The mod loader BepInEx will load any .dll files in there. I would right-click the `BuffKit` folder and compress to a .zip file.
4. Manual complete mod loader uninstall:
    - Delete folder `Guns of Icarus Online\BepInEx`. Make a backup if there is any mod settings you want to keep.
    - Delete files `changelog.txt doorstop_config.ini version.dll` in `Guns of Icarus Online` folder.

# Developer Notes
## Building and installing
Dr. Pit Lazarus is using Visual Studio 2022 as his IDE. 
Any code editor should work if you can use build configs `Release to GameDir` and `Release to .zip`.

Clone the repo and open up the BuffKit solution.

Edit `.\BuffKit\GamePath.txt` to point to your game folder.  
Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Guns of Icarus Online`.

This project does not use reflection, but publicizes game assemblies with [BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer.MSBuild](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer). Simply add `Publicize="true"` to the `Reference` tag in `BuffKit.csproj`.

To build BuffKit, use these build configs: 

`Release to GameDir`: Reads `.\BuffKit\GamePath.txt` and copies it over.

`Release to .zip`: Outputs `.\BuffKit\bin\BuffKit_SCS_$(Version).zip`.

You may see reference errors after cloning. Ensure `.\BuffKit\GamePath.txt` is correct and build the project. The InitialTarget `CopyAssemblies` will copy assembiles before the build process starts.  
All build configs will stage the mod directory in `.\BuffKit\bin\temp\`. 
It will download BepInEx core files, and copy BuffKit.dll and assets. 
See `.\BuffKit\BuffKit.csproj` for the exact steps.

**The BuffKit must grow.**

## Spanner
> [!WARNING]
> Deprecated. Replaced with [BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer.MSBuild](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer).

<details><summary>Old description</summary>
    
Edit `.\Binaries\spanner_config.toml` and `.\BuffKit\GamePath.txt` to your game folder. 
Example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Guns of Icarus Online`.

`./Binaries/Spanner.exe` is the tool that will copy the game assemblies to `.\Assemblies\`. 
It will deprivatize classes and methods so you can use them without needing to use reflection. 
Run it with terminal or run it normally and check the `spanner_log.txt` for errors. 
You need .NET 8 runtime to run it. 
You should only need to run it once, unless you make changes to the spanner config.

Nothing much here. Open the Spanner solution and use publish to build the single file Spanner.exe. 
Put the new .exe in `.\Binaries\`.
